# Colony Starter

_Learn to build with Colony! Get a head start on your next project!_ Colony Starter (formerly known as "Hackathon Starter") includes a variety of starter projects that demonstrate how to use and integrate different tools with Colony.

## Get Started

### Prerequisites

- Yarn
- Docker
- Node 9.10

_Note: You may find it helpful to use Node Version Manager (`nvm`) to manage node versions._

### Step 1

Globally install the [colony-starter](/packages/colony-starter) package:

```
yarn global add @colony/colony-starter
```

### Step 2

Move to your working directory and unpack the [colony-starter-basic](/packages/colony-starter-basic) package:

```
yarn colony-starter colony-starter-basic
```

### Step 3

Move to your new project directory and checkout the [colony-starter-basic](/packages/colony-starter-basic) readme:

```
cd colony-starter-basic
```

## Starter Projects

Now that you have a basic understanding of how Colony works, check out some of the other starter projects by repeating steps 2 and 3 and substituting `colony-starter-basic` with the project of your choice!
