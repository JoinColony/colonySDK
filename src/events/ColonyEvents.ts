   * We can do that as we do not have ambiguous events across our contracts, so we will always be able to find the right contract to parse the event data later on
   *
   * @example
   * Filter for all `DomainAdded` events between block 21830000 and 21840000 (across all deployed [[ColonyNetwork.Colony]] contracts)

   * ```
   *
   * @typeParam T Needs to be a valid [[EventSource]] (i.e. from `colonyEvents.eventSources`)
   * @typeParam N An event signature as defined in the _ethers_ contract's [`filters`](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract/#Contract--filters) object.
   * See the [ColonyJS documentation](https://colony.gitbook.io/colony/colonyjs) for a list of all available contracts and events
   *
   * @param contract A valid [[EventSource]]
   * @param eventName A valid event signature from the contract's `filters` object
   * @param address Address of the contract that can emit this event
   * @param params Parameters to filter by for the event. Has to be indexed in the contract (see _ethers_ [Event Filters](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/contract/contract/#Contract--filters))
