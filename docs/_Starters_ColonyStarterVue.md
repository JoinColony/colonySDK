_A boilerplate to get started with [colonyJS](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyJS) using Vue!_

## Prerequisites

- Node `>=10.12.0`
- Yarn `>=1.12.0`
- Docker `>=18.09.0`

_You may find it helpful to use Node Version Manager (`nvm`) to manage Node versions._

_If you are using Linux, check out [Linux Setup](/docs-linux-setup/) to ensure Yarn and Docker are set up accordingly._

## Installation

Globally install the [colony-cli](/cli-colony-cli) package.

```
yarn global add @colony/colony-cli
```

Install the `colony-starter-vue` package.

```
colony build colony-starter-vue
```

Alternatively, you can use [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx) and kickstart the `colony-starter-vue` package in one line without having to globally add the [colony-cli](/cli-colony-cli) package:

```
npx -p @colony/colony-starter colony build colony-starter-vue
```

## Run Examples

### Start Network

Open a new terminal window and start [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli):

```
yarn start-ganache
```

### Deploy Contracts

Open a new terminal window and deploy the [colonyNetwork](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork) contracts:

```
yarn deploy-contracts
```

### Start TrufflePig

Once the contracts have been deployed, start [TrufflePig](https://github.com/JoinColony/trufflepig):

```
yarn start-trufflepig
```

### Seed Network

Open a new terminal window and run the seed network script:

```
yarn seed-network
```

### Colony Setup

Once the network has been seeded, run the colony setup script:

```
yarn colony-setup
```

### Start Server

Once your colony has been set up, start the development server:

```
yarn serve
```

### Open Browser

Open your browser and check out the example vue app::
