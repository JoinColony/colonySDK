# Class: VotingReputation

## `VotingReputation` (Motions & Disputes)

The `VotingReputation` extension allows any member of a Colony to propose a Motion to take an `action` that will pass after a security delay unless somebody Objects. This applies to all actions, such as creating an expenditure, managing funds, or managing teams.

### What is a Motion?

Within Colony a Motion is an on-chain proposal whose two sides (_Yay_ or _Nay_) can be supported by staking the Colony's native token for that side. Motions _always_ have an `action` attached to them which is a contract transaction that can take place in a Colony. For example, Motions could be created to move funds from one team to another, for paying someone that did work or minting new native tokens (even arbitrary transaction on any contract in the name of the Colony are supported!).
Motions that pass (the outcome is _Yay_) will execute the `action` once they are finalized. If the outcome is _Nay_, there is no action taking place.

### The Motion lifecycle

:::info

The exact lifecycle is determined by the parameters that were set when the `VotingReputation` extension was installed for the Colony. You can find a detailed explanation of all the parameters [here](https://colony.gitbook.io/colony/extensions/governance/parameters).

:::

#### Creating a Motion

See [MotionCreator](MotionCreator.md).

Anyone within a Colony can start a motion. In Colony SDK, this can be done with the [MotionCreator](MotionCreator.md) API. There the `action` (the contract transaction) for the Motion will be defined. This is essentially nothing else than an encoded contract function string alongside its parameters (see for detailed info [here](https://medium.com/linum-labs/a-technical-primer-on-using-encoded-function-calls-50e2b9939223) - but don't worry. In Colony SDK this will all be taken care of by the [MotionCreator](MotionCreator.md)).

 #### Staking

See [VotingReputation.stakeMotion](VotingReputation.md#stakemotion).

Once a motion is created, native tokens can be staked to support either of its sides (_Yay_ or _Nay_). A user can only stake as many tokens for either side as they have reputation in the team the motion is created in. A side can be staked by the motion creator and an arbitrary number of additional users as long as they adhere to the minimum stake per user that was defined in the extensions parameters. The maximum amount a user can stake is also determined by the amount of reputation in the team in which the Motion takes place.

:::caution Over-staking

Once a side of a Motion is activated, further attempts to stake tokens for that side will revert. It is not necessary or sensible to stake more tokens than needed. Keep in mind that both sides can be activated at the same time (see below for what happens then). You can use the [VotingReputation.getRemainingStakes](VotingReputation.md#getremainingstakes) method to see how many tokens need to be staked on each side for them to activate.

:::

After the staking phase (which has a predetermined runtime) one of these four cases can happen:

* **Case 1**: _Yay_ side reaches minimum stakes, _Nay_ side does not: the motion passed and can be finalized. All stakes are returned
* **Case 2**: _Nay_ side reaches minimum stakes, _Yay_ side does not: the motion failed and will not execute. All stakes are returned
* **Case 3**: Neither _Yay_ or _Nay_ side have reached minimum stakes: nothing happens. All stakes are returned.
* **Case 4**: Both _Yay_ and _Nay_ sides are activated. The Motion will go into _Voting_ immediately (and will not wait out the staking period).

#### Voting

See [VotingReputation.submitVote](VotingReputation.md#submitvote).

As soon as the voting phase starts, anyone with reputation in the team the Motion was created in can vote for a side. Votes are secret (i.e. they're encrypted using your private key), and weighted by reputation. Vote weight is proportional to the voter's reputation in the team in which the vote is occurring.

Voters receive a reward for voting proportional to their reputation in the team in which the vote is occurring. The reward comes from the stake provided by whichever side of the dispute loses. It doesn't matter whether the voter voters for the winning or the losing side, they are rewarded the same either way.

#### Revealing the votes

See [VotingReputation.revealVote](VotingReputation.md#revealvote).

After the voting period is complete, the Reveal phase starts. Votes must be Revealed in order to be counted, and for the voter to receive their voter reward. The Reveal phase ends when either the time runs out, or everyone who has voted reveals their vote, whichever comes first.

:::danger Staking penalties

If you staked tokens for the side that eventually lost you will lose some of your stake. The amount lost will be smaller the closer the decision ultimately ended up being.

### The structure of a Motion

You can - at any point in the lifecycle inspect the current state of a Motion. Using the [VotingReputation.getMotion](VotingReputation.md#getmotion) method, the resulting object will have the following properties:

Stake `amount` to support a motion with your vote

**`Remarks`**

In order to stake a motion the amount to stake (or any amount higher than that) needs to be "activated" and approved for staking in the motion's team first. See below for a full example. Usually you would have more tokens "activated" or even approved for a domain than you would stake, to make this process more seamless

**`Example`**

```typescript
import { Vote, w } from '@colony/sdk';

// Immediately executing async function
(async function() {
  const token = colony.getToken();
  // Approve 200 tokens to be "activated"
  await token.approve(w`200`);
  // Deposit all of approved the tokens
  await token.deposit(w`200`);
  // Approve 150 tokens for staking in the root domain
  await colony.ext.motions.approveStake(w`150`);
  // Stake 100 tokens for motion with id 3
  await colony.ext.motions.stakeMotion(3, Vote.Yay, w`100`);
})();
